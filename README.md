Completed by Angela Diamidia
## Problem statement
Understand the target Customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy.
## Context
Identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and the mall shopping score.

## Objective
The objective is to divide the mall target into approachable groups, by creating a subset of a market based on demographics behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activities.

## The Approach
1.	Perform some quick EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2.	Use KMEANS Clustering Algorithm to create our segments
3.	Use summary statistics on the clusters 
4.	Visualize 

## Steps to solve the problem
Using Python (Jupyter notebook)
1.	Importing Libraries
2.	Exploration of data
3.	Data Visualization
4.	Clustering using K-Means
5.	Selection of Clusters
6.	Plotting the Cluster Boundary and Clusters
7.	3D Plot of Clusters
